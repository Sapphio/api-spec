# App.net API Documentation

App.net is a subscription-based, ad-free social network and API, a home for meaningful interactions and a platform developers can trust. We rely on our developers and our developers can rely on us for a robust, responsive and transparent platform. 

Welcome aboard!

This page is your starting point to getting familiar with the App.net developer platform. Our aim is to get you up and running as quickly and easily as possible. What you see here is always under revision and we always want you to give us your feedback.

### Tracking news and announcements

### Getting help and providing feedback

There are numerous ways for developers to get help utilizing the platform and to provide feedback. During typical San Francisco business hours there are App.net staff members available to answer questions in our [HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com/garqCaGOZ). Developers (along with App.net staff) are often chatting in the [Developer Channel](http://patter-app.net/room.html?channel=1383). For general inquiries about account/service related issues email [support@app.net](mailto:support@app.net). For developer inquiries about the API, our Terms of Service, letting us know about something you're working on, etc., email [developers@app.net](mailto:developers@app.net). In addition to the above you can report bugs and provide feedback on the API using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec/issues) or by using pull requests and commit comments on the [Github repo for the API](https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec/) or the repo for these docs.

### Terms of Service

All usage of the App.net API is governed by our [Developer Terms of Service]( https://account.app.net/legal/developer-terms/). We spent a great deal of time making this document readable, concise, and developer friendly. Please take the time to review it. 

### Registering your app

Establishing a robust ecosystem of great apps is critical for our success. We're always looking for more ways to promote the work of our third party developers.
