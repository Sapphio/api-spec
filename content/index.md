# App.net API Documentation

App.net is a subscription-based, ad-free social network and API, a home for meaningful interactions and a platform developers can trust. We rely on our developers and our developers can rely on us for a robust, responsive and transparent platform. 

Welcome aboard!

This page is your starting point to getting familiar with the App.net developer platform. Our aim is to get you up and running as quickly and easily as possible. What you see here is always under revision and we always want you to give us your feedback.
