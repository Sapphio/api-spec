## Update a User

Updates a specific user's profile details. You can update a user by PUTing an object that matches the [User schema](/docs/resources/user/) with an HTTP header of ```Content-Type: application/json```. You must provide values for each of the following keys: ```name```, ```locale```, ```timezone```, and ```description```. If you would only like to update a subset of those keys, you can also [partially update a user](#partially-update-a-user).

For the description, you must specify ```description.text``` as a child key. You can also specify [custom links](/docs/meta/entities/#user-specified-entities) for a user description. If you want to test how your text will be processed you can use the [text processor](/docs/resources/text-processor).

If you want to add or update a User's annotations, you may include the optional ```annotations``` key and pass in the annotations that are changing.
