# Place

* TOC
{:toc}

Place objects represent physical locations which can be given a name and associated with a latitude and longitude somewhere on Earth. For example, the Caltrain station in San Francisco, CA at 700 4th St., which has a location of latitude 37.776905, longitude -122.395012, can be considered a Place. In order to provide accurate and thorough Place data, we use a database from [factual.com](http://factual.com/). As such, all of our Places use the same UUIDs as those retrieved from factual.com.

In the future, Places may eventually sit at multiple categorical "leaf nodes" and as a result, we provide lists of category objects (though for now, no Place will be associated with more than one category ID).

## Attaching Places to other resources

Places can be attached to any resource that allows annotations. You can insert Place data into any annotation using the [`+net.app.core.place` replacement value](https://github.com/appdotnet/object-metadata/blob/master/annotation-replacement-values/+net.app.core.place.md) and providing a `factual_id`. For more information, see the [annotation replacement values](/reference/meta/annotations/#annotation-replacement-values) documentation.

We provide a [Checkin annotation](https://github.com/appdotnet/object-metadata/blob/master/annotations/net.app.core.checkin.md) as a [core annotation](/reference/meta/annotations/#core-annotations) for the common use case of using Place data to give users a way to say "I was here when I posted this", though developers are free to use Place data in other contexts.

## Retrieve a Place

Returns info about a Place object with a given `factual_id`.

### Deduplication effects

Because it is possible for duplicate entries to exist for the same Place, Factual provides a method to deduplicate one Place object by "replacing" it with another. As a result, you may notice sometimes that when requesting a Place with one `factual_id` you will get back an entry with a different `factual_id`. When we return a different Place than the one you requested we are claiming, to the best of our knowledge, that it is equivalent to the one requested.

<%= endpoint "GET", "places/[factual_id]", "Any" %>

<%= url_params [
    ["factual_id", "The Factual id of the Place to retrieve."]
]%>

#### Example

<%= curl_example(:get, "places/19931850-dc2f-012e-561d-003048cad9da", :place) %>

## Search for a Place

Performs a search for nearest places from given latitude and longitude. Optionally takes a `q` string to restrict matches on name (like autocomplete for Place names).

Returns a list of Places sorted by distance or distance/string match if `q` is provided. These are the same Place objects as returned by the previous endpoint but will also include a `distance` property which gives, in meters, the distance from the search centroid to the Place.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="alert alert-error alert-block">
**When using this endpoint, it is a requirement that _all_ requests originate from user actions.** As an example, acceptable use cases include when a user presses a button to search for local Places or when a user types a character to specify part of a Place name. Unacceptable use cases include automated access (e.g. "bots", "scrapers"), periodic scans and attempts to create comprehensive local caches or copies of the Place data. **We will be monitoring search usage and will take necessary actions to terminate unacceptable use.**
