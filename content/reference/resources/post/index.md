# Post

<%= render 'partials/object-tab' %>

* TOC
{:toc}

A Post is the other central object utilized by the App.net Stream API. It has rich text and annotations which comprise all of the content a users sees in their feed. Posts are closely tied to the follow graph. If you want to create data that isn't tied to the follow graph, you should look at [Messages](/reference/resources/message/).

<%= json(:full_post) %>

</table>

### Deprecations

* `deleted` has been deprecated and replaced with `is_deleted`. This key should not be used and will be removed from the Post object soon.

## Post Annotations
Post annotations are immutable attributes that describe the entire post. Please see the [Annotations](/reference/meta/annotations/) documentation for more information.

## Machine only Posts
Some posts with annotations data may not be meant for direct consumption by a User. For example, a chess app may create Posts with annotations representing chess moves but having human readable text doesn't make sense. Machine only Posts solve this problem by allowing clients to create posts with `annotations` and without `text`. These posts must be specifically asked for by using the `include_machine=1` query string parameter. They must contain at least one annotation and cannot contain any text. When deciding if a Post should be machine only, ask yourself "Would this Post make sense to a human?"

## General parameters

Where noted, Post endpoints respond to the following query string parameters:

<table class='table table-striped'>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Required?</th>
            <th width="50">Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>include_muted</code></td>
            <td>Optional</td>
            <td>integer (0 or 1)</td>
            <td>Should Posts from muted users be included? Defaults to false except when you specifically request a Post from a muted user or when you specifically request a muted user's stream.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>include_deleted</code></td>
            <td>Optional</td>

            <td>integer (0 or 1)</td>
            <td>Should Posts directed at people I don't follow be included? A directed Post is a Post that has <a href="/reference/meta/entities/#mentions">leading mentions</a> (mentions at the beginning of the text). A machine only Post with mentions is also considered a directed Post. Defaults to false for "My Stream" and true everywhere else.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>include_machine</code></td>
            <td>Optional</td>
            <td>integer (0 or 1)</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>include_html</code></td>
            <td>Optional</td>
            <td>integer (0 or 1)</td>
            <td>Should the <a href="/reference/resources/post/#post-fields"><code>html</code> field</a> be included alongside the <code>text</code> field in the response objects? Defaults to true.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Where noted, endpoints that return a stream of Posts additionally respond to [pagination parameters](/reference/make-request/pagination).


## Stream Faceting parameters

Stream Faceting allows you to filter and query a user's [personalized stream](/reference/resources/post/streams/#retrieve-a-users-personalized-stream) or [unified stream](/reference/resources/post/streams/#retrieve-a-users-unified-stream) with an interface similar to our [Post Search API](/reference/resources/post/search/#search-for-posts). If you use stream faceting, the API will only return recent posts in a user's stream.

Currently the following stream facets are supported:

<table class='table table-striped'>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Required?</th>
            <th width="50">Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>has_oembed_photo</code></td>
            <td>Optional</td>
            <td>integer (0 or 1)</td>
            <td>Only include posts with photo oembed annotations.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


## Sorting Posts

Post `id` is the ordering field for multiple posts, not `created_at`. `created_at` is meant to be displayed to users, not to sort Posts. This also makes pagination with `since_id` and `before_id` more straightforward. Posts are presently always returned in reverse chronological order (newest to oldest). As a result, the Posts endpoints will always return the newest posts that meet the requested criteria (e.g. `before_id` and `count`).
