# Authorize via App.net SDK

On iOS and Android, App.net provides SDKs to streamline the process of a user authenticating your app. This is also the easiest way for a new user to sign up for App.net via their mobile device. Both SDKs work in similar ways:

1. The developer integrates the SDK into their native app
2. The developer shows the user a "Log in" button
3. When the user taps that button, they are taken to the Official App.net App.
4. Once the user authorizes the developer's app, the Official App.net App returns the user to the developer's app with an access token.
