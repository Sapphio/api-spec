## Authorize With App.net Button

The easiest way to integrate a web flow into your app is through an "Authorize with App.net" Button, which allows current App.net users to enjoy the ease of authorizing your app in two clicks. Less means more, as they'll be able to start using your app even faster.

As an added benefit, this button will also allow new users to sign up for a free account and then authorize your app.

### Benefits

1. **It's easy**: Add an Authorize with App.net button to your site in seconds.
1. **It's beautiful**: The minimal style of the button is versatile and users will recognize the App.net branding.
1. **It's useful**: Your potential users can either sign up or sign in to your app with the same button.

### Implementation

To implement the button on your site, you must:

1. Build [Your authentication URL](/reference/authentication/flows/web/).
1. Replace the variables inside the brackets
1. Copy and paste the snippet below into your HTML where you want the button to show up


~~~html
<a href='[Your authentication URL]' class='adn-button' data-type='authorize_v2' data-width="145" data-height="22" >Authorize with App.net</a><script>(function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src='//d2zh9g63fcvyrq.cloudfront.net/adn.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'adn-button-js'));</script>
~~~

If you do everything correctly you should see a button like this:

### Best Practices

We suggest that you put the following copy directly above or below the button:

    An App.net account is required to use [Your App Name]. You can create an account and sign in by clicking this button.
