# API Reference

These pages contain the complete specification of how the App.net API works. We try to follow standard practices to make our API easy to use from one of our [client libraries](/docs/libraries/) or from any normal HTTP client. We use standard HTTP headers to [authorize your use of the API](/reference/authentication/) and to [rate limit requests](/reference/make-request/rate-limits/). Our [API responses](/reference/make-request/responses/) are always JSON encoded and use appropriate [HTTP error codes](/reference/make-request/responses/#possible-http-status-codes) to signify an API failure. Once you're familiar with the building blocks of our API, we encourage you to explore the different [resources](/reference/resources/) for detailed documentation.
