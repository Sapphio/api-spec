# Web Intents

* TOC
{:toc}

Web intents are an easy way to integrate with App.net; you don't even need to use Javascript. Intents in their most basic form are just carefully constructed URLs. By clicking on an intent link, a user will be taken to a page on App.net with a prompt to carry out an action, such as creating a post. If the user is not logged in to App.net, she/he will first authenticate before being presented with the action dialog.

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you just want a simple follow or share button you can use <a href='http://app.net/about/buttons/'>button builder</a> instead. We've also open sourced the buttons so that you could host them your self. Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/appdotnet/piha">github repo</a> for more information on how to do that.</p>

## The Post Intent

The post intent allows you to create a link that will present the user with a post creation box and any pre-filled text that you may have supplied.

The base URL for this intent is `https://alpha.app.net/intent/post/`.

You may optionally prepopulate the post creation box by supplying a `text` query parameter to the URL.

For example, this URL `https://alpha.app.net/intent/post/?text=%40adn%20When%20is%20the%20next%20meetup%3F` will create a post that reads:

> @adn When is the next meetup?

At this point the end user will be able to edit and then submit the post.

There is a second optional parameter:  `url`. This allows you to automatically appended a URL to a post.

For example, this URL: `https://alpha.app.net/intent/post/?text=%40adn%20Does%20this%20place%20work%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.google.com%2Fmaps%3Fq%3Dpublic%2Bhouse%2Bsf%26fb%3D1%26gl%3Dus%26hq%3Dpublic%2Bhouse%26hnear%3D0x80859a6d00690021%3A0x4a501367f076adff%2CSan%2BFrancisco%2C%2BCA%26cid%3D0%2C0%2C2651066427117992613%26t%3Dm%26z%3D16%26iwloc%3DA` will create a post that reads:

> @adn Does this place work? <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=public+house+sf&fb=1&gl=us&hq=public+house&hnear=0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff,San+Francisco,+CA&cid=0,0,2651066427117992613&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A">https://maps.google.com/maps?q=public+â€¦</a>

You'll notice that the displayed URL is automatically truncated to 40 chars. The full URL is included though. If your URL is less then 40 chars it will be included as is.


## The Follow Intent

The follow intent is an easy way to link to a page on App.net that will present the user with an opportunity to follow a selected user.

The base URL for this intent is ```https://alpha.app.net/intent/follow/```.

You must include a user that is the intended target of the follow action. To do this include a ```user_id``` query parameter in the URL. The ```user_id``` can be a username prepended by a @, like @adn, or it can be the numeric user_id, like 136.

For example, this URL ```https://alpha.app.net/intent/follow/?user_id=136``` will show page where the user can choose to follow the user @adn.
